# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To build this webiste has been very educational. Going from knowing very little about to code to just a little more shows that this process will not only be challenging but also fun.

This project was built so that I can start to learn and impliment diffrent skill such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Git. This also gave me a chance to start using GitHub, Terminal, Build and add an SSH key to my computer and Repo.

This website solves the problem about where to go to store, study, and take notes while also learning how to build with code.

A wonderful first step towards becoming a web developer.
