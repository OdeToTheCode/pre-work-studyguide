## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I built this study guide to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built this project to start implimenting my learned skills through terminal, Git, and GitHub. This project allowed me to learn how to build and add ssh keys, to my computer and to my respositories. Allowed me to dip my toes into a few coding languages and build my first website with the help of a prework module for my bootcamp.

This allowed me to warm up to web develepment in a healthy way. This website is a good place for a student to store and access notes on the above stated languages. Building this website allowed me to learn how to add and update my repository through my terminal, create and work inside of branches, and trouble shoot/add code without directly effecting my main code until the work was finalized.

## Usage

This website is a wonderful way to see how you can go from knowing very little about coding to building a simple website. The webiste is a good place to refrence for a starting point into coding while seeing notes on various langueges. If you use dev tools to see the code being used, you can also see that JavaScript is running in the backgound to help you decide what to study first.
